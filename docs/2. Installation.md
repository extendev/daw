## Installing HTTP/API Services

- Install Apache 2.2
- Copy/paste contents of the module *etc/httpd.conf* file to your Apache *httpd.conf* to install the virtual hosts associated to API and HTTPd services. Both services are independent so you do not need to install both services if you do not need to.
- Start Apache

Make sure installation is ok by accessing following URLs:

 - http[s]://${host>:${port}/version for the API service
